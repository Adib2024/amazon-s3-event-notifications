# ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 File Sharing with Event Notifications

## üìñ Project Description

This project demonstrates how to configure an **Amazon S3 bucket** for secure file sharing and implement **real-time email notifications** using **Amazon SNS**. The scenario simulates an external media user (`mediacouser`) who uploads and manages image files for a caf√©. Administrators receive email alerts whenever files are added or removed.

This project is ideal for beginners learning **AWS S3**, **IAM**, and **event-driven architecture**, and is based on a lab from the **AWS re/Start Program**.

The following steps describe the usage flow in the diagram:
1.	When new product pictures are available or when existing pictures must be updated, a representative from the media company signs in to the AWS Management Console as (`mediacouser`) to upload, change, or delete the bucket contents.
2.	As an alternative, (`mediacouser`) can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to change the contents of the S3 bucket.
3.	When Amazon S3 detects a change in the contents of the bucket, it publishes an email notification to the s3NotificationTopic Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.
4.	The administrator who is subscribed to the s3NotificationTopic SNS topic receives an email message that contains the details of the changes to the contents of the bucket. 

Note: In real-world implementations, external users might not receive direct access to CLI Host as depicted in the diagram.

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with necessary permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Linux environment (CLI Host)

---

### 1. **Create an S3 bucket**

Choose a unique bucket name (must be globally unique):

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://<your-bucket-name> --region us-west-2
```

üìå _Example_:  
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://cafe-demo-012345 --region us-west-2
```

---

### 2. **Upload sample images to the `images/` folder**

```bash
aws s3 sync ~/initial-images/ s3://<your-bucket-name>/images
```

---

### 3. **Verify that the files are in the S3 bucket**

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://<your-bucket-name>/images/ --human-readable --summarize
```

---

### 4. **Set up IAM user `(`mediacouser`)` with limited access**

Attach a policy like this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "AllowGroupToSeeBucketListInTheConsole"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::cafe-*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::cafe-*/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "AllowRootLevelListingOfTheBucket"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:DeleteObjectVersion"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cafe-*/images/*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "AllowUserSpecificActionsOnlyInTheSpecificPrefix"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Policy Statements Description

- **`AllowGroupToSeeBucketListInTheConsole`**  
  Grants permissions that allow the user to use the Amazon S3 console to view the list of S3 buckets in the account.

- **`AllowRootLevelListingOfTheBucket`**  
  Grants permissions that allow the user to use the Amazon S3 console to view the list of first-level objects in the `cafe` bucket and other objects in the bucket.

- **`AllowUserSpecificActionsOnlyInTheSpecificPrefix`**  
  Grants permissions for actions the user can perform on the objects in the `cafe-*/images/*` folder.  
  The main operations include:
  - `GetObject` (read)
  - `PutObject` (write)
  - `DeleteObject` (delete)  
  Additionally, it includes operations for version-related actions.

---

Sign into (`mediacouser`) account and view the content of S3 Bucket. The user able to upload new file into the S3 bucket:

User do not have permission to rename the object:

<img align="center" alt="Rename denied" src="https://github.com/Adib2024/amazon-s3-event-notifications/blob/main/rename%20denied.png" />

User have permission to delete the object:

<img align="center" alt="delete permission" src="https://github.com/Adib2024/amazon-s3-event-notifications/blob/main/delete%20permission.png" />


---

### 5. **Create an SNS topic and subscribe your email**

Back to root user

```bash
aws sns create-topic --name s3NotificationTopic
```

Then subscribe:

```bash
aws sns subscribe   --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:s3NotificationTopic   --protocol email   --notification-endpoint your-email@example.com
```

---

### 6. **Add SNS permissions to allow S3 to publish**

Use this SNS topic policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "S3PublishPolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublishFromS3",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "<ARN of s3NotificationTopic>",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:*:*:<your-bucket-name>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


```

### Subscribe to the SNS Topic

1. In the **Topic ARN** box, choose the `s3NotificationTopic` SNS topic that appears as an option.
2. From the **Protocol** dropdown list, choose **Email**.
3. In the **Endpoint** box, enter an email address that you can access.
4. Choose **Create subscription**.
5. Check your email inbox ‚Äî a **Subscription Confirmation** email will be sent.
6. Confirm the subscription by clicking the link in the email.


---

### 7. **Create and apply `s3EventNotification.json`**

```json
{
    "TopicConfigurations": [
      {
        "TopicArn": "<ARN of s3NotificationTopic>",
        "Events": ["s3:ObjectCreated:*","s3:ObjectRemoved:*"],
        "Filter": {
          "Key": {
            "FilterRules": [
              {
                "Name": "prefix",
                "Value": "images/"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }


```

To associate the event configuration file with the S3 share bucket, run the following command
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration   --bucket <your-bucket-name>   --notification-configuration file://s3EventNotification.json
```

Email should be like:

<img align="center" alt="SNS S3 email" src="https://github.com/Adib2024/amazon-s3-event-notifications/blob/main/SNS%20S3%20email.png" />

---

### 8. **Test the configuration**

Test the S3 bucket event notifications by simulating (`mediacouser`) actions: uploading and deleting objects (triggering email alerts), and attempting an unauthorized action (to confirm it's blocked), using the AWS s3api CLI.

Run 'aws configure' and sign into (`mediacouser`) to test the configuration:


CREATE and DELETE Object on S3 Bucket

```

#### ‚ùå Try unauthorized action

```

#### üóëÔ∏è Delete an object
```bash
aws s3 rm s3://<your-bucket-name>/images/sample.jpg
```
